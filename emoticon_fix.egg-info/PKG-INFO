        A lightweight and efficient library for transforming emoticons into their semantic meanings. This is particularly useful for NLP preprocessing where emoticons need to be preserved as meaningful text.

        ## What are emoticons?
        
        An emoticon (short for "emotion icon") is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood. The first ASCII emoticons, `:-)` and `:-(`, were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.
        
        ## Why transform emoticons to text?
        
        When preprocessing text for NLP models, simply removing punctuation can leave emoticons as meaningless characters. For example, `":D"` (laugh) would become just `"D"`. This can negatively impact model performance. By transforming emoticons to their textual meanings, we preserve the emotional context in a format that's more meaningful for NLP tasks.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install emoticon-fix
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix
        
        # Basic usage
        text = 'Hello :) World :D'
        result = emoticon_fix(text)
        print(result)  # Output: 'Hello Smile World Laugh'
        
        # Works with multiple emoticons
        text = 'I am :-) but sometimes :-( and occasionally :-D'
        result = emoticon_fix(text)
        print(result)  # Output: 'I am Smile but sometimes Sad and occasionally Laugh'
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        ### Basic Example
        ```python
        from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix
        
        text = 'test :) test :D test'
        result = emoticon_fix(text)
        print(result)  # Output: 'test Smile test Laugh test'
        ```
        
        ### Complex Example
        ```python
        from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix
        
        text = 'Feeling :-) today! But yesterday was :-( and tomorrow might be :-D'
        result = emoticon_fix(text)
        print(result)  # Output: 'Feeling Smile today! But yesterday was Sad and tomorrow might be Laugh'
        ```
