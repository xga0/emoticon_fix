A Python package to transform emoticons in text to their corresponding meanings, e.g., `:)` => `Smile`. This is particularly useful for NLP preprocessing where emoticons need to be preserved as meaningful text.

## What are emoticons?

An emoticon (short for "emotion icon") is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood. The first ASCII emoticons, `:-)` and `:-(`, were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.

## Why transform emoticons to text?

When preprocessing text for NLP models, simply removing punctuation can leave emoticons as meaningless characters. For example, `":D"` (laugh) would become just `"D"`. This can negatively impact model performance. By transforming emoticons to their textual meanings, we preserve the emotional context in a format that's more meaningful for NLP tasks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install emoticon-fix
```

## Usage

```python
from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix

# Basic usage
text = 'Hello :) World :D'
result = emoticon_fix(text)
print(result)  # Output: 'Hello Smile World Laugh'

# Works with multiple emoticons
text = 'I am :-) but sometimes :-( and occasionally :-D'
result = emoticon_fix(text)
print(result)  # Output: 'I am Smile but sometimes Sad and occasionally Laugh'
```

## Examples

### Basic Example
```python
from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix

text = 'test :) test :D test'
result = emoticon_fix(text)
print(result)  # Output: 'test Smile test Laugh test'
```

### Complex Example
```python
from emoticon_fix import emoticon_fix

text = 'Feeling :-) today! But yesterday was :-( and tomorrow might be :-D'
result = emoticon_fix(text)
print(result)  # Output: 'Feeling Smile today! But yesterday was Sad and tomorrow might be Laugh'
```
